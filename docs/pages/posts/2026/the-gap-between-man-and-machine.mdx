<b>Customer research (my definition):</b>
<br/>
The skill of asking of the questions, the search for understanding of user behavior in order make a good product that work for the users can differenciate itself from the pack.
</Callout>

Being a builder, there's this singular focus on the think that I am working on, how elegant the solutions are, how much of the latest and greatest tools I have used in solutionizing and I take a lot of pride in that.
Research and design, on the other hand, requires a bit of detatchment from solutions and a focus on the user and their problems.

To be able to empathize with users and begin by seeing the user as in fact more knowlegeable than me, a builder, can at first seem humbling but quickly becomes an empowering position to be in.
Because I don't have to come up with the answers or a version of a solution that I think will work for a user.
Instead, while really listening to a user, the answers lie in plain sight.

I have the sense that I have been enamored by the tools and this is where a lot of the disatisfaction with work has come from of late - not being able to really move the needle by just playing with toys. A lot of designers (and design researchers), on the other hand, I view as connectors - who take the time to work with people and are focussed on bridging the gaps.
And this shows at my work where a lot of user-centered people do design and research as well as perform product managerial roles while the developers (builders) want to play with toys and keep building more toys for themselves until they outdo each other.
The AI malee going is a case in point where the AI tools, as good as they are and as scary as they may also seem.
 While designers tend to the needs of the user, and advocate for them, developers sit in front of their screens pumping out lines of code like our lives depend on it - literally and figuratively.
One of the most important metric working as a developer is the technical impact on a project (or multiple).
This measure inherently pits develoepers on a scale from most to least impactful, rewarding those who are the most skillful, creative, fast and efficient.
In other words, being able to build the biggest thing is what a developer is meant to do in their career.
On the other hand, doing design work means leaning forward and attempting to understand the user and their needs.

Bridging that gap between man and machine is a necessary pursuit, as idealistic as it may be.
Most of the time, we will fail, or get distracted by wanting to use the machine so badly that we will try to adjust ourselves to fit the machines instead of building ones that work for us.
This work requires both good design in all it's aspects and development skill to execute the designs.
Perhaps this is where the gap is.
