Implementing solutions is becoming cheaper and a bit less interesting to me - at least in the sense that building out requires a level of logic of understanding how to get from design to product. Generative AI models are becoming better at executing well definined solutions. 

Researching, understanding and defining a problem is slowly becoming more fascinating because it requires of me to understand user behavior, histories, needs and articulate the core problem to be solved. This process of research puts the user at the core of problem solving where my expertise in solutionizing is almost always an unintended negative bias in how I see an issue because I'm so used to building things out. 

However, in design research, the inquiry that ensues becomes one in which I don't know what the results will reveal, but I have to be patient, honest and actively participate with the people and the process and open my mind up discovering new problems.
