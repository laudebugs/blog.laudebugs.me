Implementing solutions is becoming cheaper and a bit less interesting to me - at least in the sense that building out requires a level of logic of understanding how to get from design to product. Understanding a problem then becomes fascinating because we have to understand user behavior, histories, needs and articulate the core problem to be solved. This process of research then puts the user at the core of problem-solving where my expertise in solutionizing is almost always a bias in how I see an issue. An inquiry then ensues where I don't know what the research will reveal, but I have to be honest with the process and open my mind up to the possibilities.
