# RxJs Pitfalls: Passing in a Observer's next function as a callback to pipe operators

![Cover Image](/assets/post-covers/rxjx-pitfalls-passing-observer-next-to-pipe-able-operator.jpeg)

When working with observable streams, often one uses `RxJs` operators to pipe into the stream (i.e. using [pipe-able operators](https://rxjs.dev/guide/operators)). Some of these operators take observers as an argument. An observer is an object that consumes values delivered by an observable and often implements one or more of the `next`, `error` and `complete` functions.

The RxJs `Subject` is a type of observable that is also an observer. A common pattern I find myself implementing in several projects is defining a `Subject`, often also a `BehaviorSubject` which then holds different pieces of data to be consumed in differnt parts of an application. In order to pass data to the `Subject`, which is also an observer, we call the `.next` with the data the Subject should hold. A simple example would be while using the [`tap` operator](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/tap) to perform side effects in our observable stream.

A common pitfall is then passing `Subject.next` directly as the argument to a pipeable operator. For instance, when using `tap`, calling `tap(new Subject().next)`.
We will see how this can cause unexpected errors that are may be hard to debug and how to avoid it.

Suppose you have an RxJs subject that is keeping track of the value in an observable stream (say called `stream$`).

```tsx twoslash
import { Subject, timer, take, tap } from 'rxjs'

const stream$ = timer(0, 1000).pipe(take(5))
```

One way to pass the current value to the subject is using the `tap` operator that accepts an observer, i.e. an object containing the `next`, `error` and `complete` functions.

If we only pass a callback function that logs out the current value in the observable stream, we would have something that looks like:


<CodeSandBox
 files={{"index.js": `import { Subject, timer, take, tap } from 'rxjs'

const stream$ = timer(0, 1000).pipe(take(5))

stream$.pipe(
    tap(console.log)
).subscribe()
`}}
  template='vanilla'
  options={{
        initMode: "user-visible",
        layout: "console",
        editorWidthPercentage: 70,
        wrapContent: true
      }}
  customSetup={{ 
        dependencies: { 
          "rxjs": "latest" 
        }
      }}
/>

If we have a subject called `_count` where we would like to keep track of the current value in the stream, the first instinct would be to replace `console.log` with `_count.next`:

```ts twoslash
import { Subject, timer, take, tap } from 'rxjs'
const _count = new Subject<number>()

const stream$ = timer(0, 1000).pipe(take(5))

stream$.pipe(
    tap(_count.next)
).subscribe()
```

However, you'll notice that the above implementation **does not work**, resulting in the error: `TypeError: _this._throwIfClosed is not a function`.

The reason being that RxJs's `Subject` is a class whose `next` implementation relies on `this` keyword which refers to the `_count` instance. You can [view the source code here](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/8.x/src/internal/Subject.ts#L60). Passing just the `_count.next` function would reference `this` which refers to the global scope and not the `_count` instance.

We can see this in action by implementing our own observer that references `this`:

```tsx
const observerStore = {
    store: new Array<number>(),
    next(value: number) {
        this.store.push(value)
    },
}
/* Replacing the _count with our observer would then look like belowüëáüèª */
stream$.pipe(
    tap(observerStore.next)
).subscribe()
```

The implementation above would also give us an error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')`. For the same reason that the `this` reference would refer to the `global` object and not the `observerStore` object.

:::tip

It's worth noting that if the observer's `next` implementation does not reference the `this` keyword, then passing in the `.next` function would work as expected.

:::

For instance, if our `observerStore`'s `next` function just logged out the value, then passing in the `observerStore.next` to `tap` would work as expected since the `next` function does not reference `this`:

```tsx
const observerStore = {
    store: new Array<number>(),
    next(value: number) {
        console.log(value)
    },
}

/* Works! */
stream$.pipe(tap<number>(_count.next)).subscribe()
```

### Solutions

1. Pass in the observer object

    The straightforward solution would be to simply to pass in the observer object into the `tap` operator:

    ```tsx
    /* This works */
    stream$.pipe(
        tap(observerStore)
    ).subscribe()
    ```

2. Bind the observer to `this`

    One could use [`Function.prototype.bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) which is available to the function prototype to bind `this` to the observer object so that when `this` is referenced, the function references the observer instead of the global `this` object:

    ```tsx
    /* _count Subjct */
    stream$.pipe(
        tap(_count.next.bind(_count))
    ).subscribe()

    /* the observerStore */
    stream$.pipe(
        tap(observerStore.next.bind(observerStore))
    ).subscribe()
    ```

    [As the MDN docs state](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind), ‚ÄúThe **`bind()`** method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this`keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.‚Äù

Although both of the solutions work, passing the observer object is much more clear to another reader of the code on what is going on whereas the latter would cause someone who didn't write the code to stop and ask why we are calling `.bind` in the first place.

Happy hacking!
