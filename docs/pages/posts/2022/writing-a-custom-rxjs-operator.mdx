# Writing a Custom RxJS Operator

![Cover Image](/assets/post-covers/writing-a-custom-rxjs-operator.jpeg)

While working with `rxjs`, there are plenty of operators that one can use within the `.pipe` operator of an observable. Just take a look at the api reference here and you'll realize that `rxjs` provides all the operators that you need for most cases.

However, what if you needed to write your custom operator to transform data the way you wanted, or tweak the `captureError` operator to handle the error in a certain way and return something else in case an error happened.

In an application I was working on, for which I was using [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/) to handle any errors, I wanted to have the `captureError` to send the error message to Sentry, and return fallback data in case an error happened.

```tsx
import { captureException } from '@sentry/angular'
import { BehaviorSubject, Observable, OperatorFunction, catchError, tap } from 'rxjs'

export function consume<T>(consumer: BehaviorSubject<T>, fallback$: Observable<T>): OperatorFunction<T, T> {
    return (source$: Observable<T>) => {
        return source$.pipe(
            catchError((error) => {
                captureException(error)
                return fallback$
            }),
            tap(consumer),
        )
    }
}
```

:::tip

Note that the `rxjs` tap operator takes either an observer object. In our case, our `consumer` is a `Behavior Subject` [which is also an observer](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subject).

:::

The operator above is written in the form of [a curried function](https://javascript.info/currying-partials), that accepts two initial inputs: `consumer` - which in this case was a behavior subject that stores the current value in the observable stream, and `fallback$` which is the data to return in case an error happens. If no error happens, the `captureError` rxjs operator isn't called. In all cases, either the data from the observable stream or the fallback data is passed on to the consuming [behavior Subject.](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/BehaviorSubject)

And there we have it! Our own custom RxJS operator üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
