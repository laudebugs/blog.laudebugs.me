# Experimenting and viewing work as a play - Lessons from the Year

This past week I submitted a large part of probably the last set of features that my team will ship this year. Getting through this chunk of work got me thinking about some of the ideas and patterns that have made my work feel more satisfying this year. A lot of my day to day work involves tinkering with ideas, patterns, and trying out different approaches to solve technical challenges. And when all the pieces come together and we release the work to our users, I am happy to get validation of our teams efforts throughout the way.

Here are three things that I have applied that have been helpful in making my work this year:

## 1. signing up to experiment and try out new ideas
When the team brings up a challenge to me that I haven't encountered before or don't know how to solve, I never say that it cannot be achieved or we do not have the skillset for it if I at least have not attempted to do my research and consulted my colleagues on the topic. At work we call such investigative and open-ended work a spike. I love doing such work because they push me to explore unfamiliar territory. And almost 100% of the time learn something new that later finds its way into a feature or a way of improving an already-existing implementation. Doing this has delivered the most compounding of learnings over time as I have applied the lessons in work that has come later in the year.

## 2. solve the hardest problem first
Usually when tackling a large-enough project, there's always one or two core technical challenges that make up a big chunk of the work to be done. These usually need more time commitment and tend to present an opportunity for learning something new. Getting to the core problems faster through rapid prototyping has helped me utilize my energy well by solving the most technically challenging problems when I have the most drive and energy. The rest of the work is mostly patching up the solutions to the core problems and cleaning out the rough edges.

## 3. understanding how I work best
For me, short bursts of getting several low-stakes tasks done paired with longer-projects where I can focus days and even a week or more on is usually a good balance. For larger projects, I have found that I tend to shut out everything else when working on something and let it occupy my mind as I make progress. Then I can keep a steady rhythm of high focus until I get the work through the door.

These are lessons that I will keep building upon.
